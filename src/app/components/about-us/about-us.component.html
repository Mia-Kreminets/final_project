    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Oops, did I say "us"? Sorry for the confusion. The truth is, this entire project was brought to life by just one
      person. Yep, it's a solo act! But, of course, special thanks are in order:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>My friends</strong>: For their moral support and constant encouragement. You guys kept me going!</li>
      <li><strong>Unbelievably tasty pizza</strong>: For being my late-night fuel. Seriously, nothing boosts my mood and
        energy quite like you.</li>
      <li><strong>Coffee</strong>: Without you, dear coffee, this project would have taken an eternity. You kept me
        awake
        and focused during those long nights.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So, while it's just me behind the scenes, I couldn't have done it without my amazing support crew (even if they
      are pizza and coffee and cheer-ups)!</p>
